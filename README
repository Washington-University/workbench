Connectome Workbench requires QT5 or later to compile.  It is not recommended to use a version earlier than 5.6 (due to an issue with the toolbar size).

It is highly recommended to compile with OSMesa, which allow the -show-scene command and the "render pixmap" image capture method to work.  Use it by setting the *cmake* variable WORKBENCH_MESA_DIR, such that ${WORKBENCH_MESA_DIR}/include/GL/osmesa.h exists.

It is compiled using cmake, for example, on linux you can do:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D WORKBENCH_MESA_DIR=/usr -D WORKBENCH_USE_QT5=TRUE ../workbench/src
nice make -j8

For other OSes, see http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html

Note the -j flag of "make" is used in the example to speed up the build by compiling multiple source files at the same time.  If you have a different number of cores/hardware threads or want to reduce the load, adjust it accordingly.  The "nice" command is not needed, it is used to make the compilation have less priority than other processes.

This produces 3 executables, 2 of which are useful to the end user (Desktop/wb_view, CommandLine/wb_command), and one for running internal tests (Tests/test_driver).

To run the (few) tests available:

ctest
#OR
make test

To install wb_view, wb_command, wb_shortcuts, and the bash completion script to the default locations:

make install

It should be noted that wb_import, provided in the HCP binary releases of Connectome Workbench, is actually part of caret5 (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download).
