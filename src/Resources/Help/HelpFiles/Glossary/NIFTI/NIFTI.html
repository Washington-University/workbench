      </font></b><font face="Calibri">NIFTI (*.nii and *nii.gz) is
      standard file format for volumetric data that is widely used in
      neuroimaging.&nbsp; The original NIFTI-1 file format was based on
      16-bit signed integers and was limited to 32,767 in each
      dimension.&nbsp; The NIFTI-2 format (<a

      is based on 64-bit integers and can handle very large volumes and
      matrices.</font><br>
