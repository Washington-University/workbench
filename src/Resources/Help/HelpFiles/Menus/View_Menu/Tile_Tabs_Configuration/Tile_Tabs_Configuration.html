      <li><font face="Calibri"><b>Custom Grid</b> - Allows the user to
          customize the configuration of the Tile Tabs grid layout
          including number of rows, number of columns, heights of the
          rows, and widths of the columns.&nbsp; If the Custom
          Configuration contains insufficient rows and columns for the
          Window's Tabs, some tabs will not be displayed.&nbsp;
          Conversely, there will be empty space at the bottom when the
          Tile Tabs Configuration contains space for more tabs than are
          currently in the Window.&nbsp; The user may also designate
          rows or columns as 'Spacers' that are typically used for text
          annotations row/column headers.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Calibri"><b>M</b><b>anual</b> - A better name for
          "Manual Configuration" may be "No Configuration" as wb_view
          makes no effort to position and size tabs in the window.&nbsp;
          Instead, it requires the user to position and size all tabs,
          providing the utmost in layout flexibility.&nbsp; Tabs may be
          placed anywhere in the window including partially outside the
          window and a tab may overlap other tabs.&nbsp; Unlike the
          Custom Grid, there is no editing of the configuration to add
          or remove tabs.&nbsp; Adding a new tab (File Menu -&gt; New
          Tab), places the new tab in the window and the user will need
          to adjust the position and size of the new tab.&nbsp; When a
          tab is removed (File Menu -&gt; Close Tab, or clicking a tab's
          Close button in the tab bar), the tab is removed from the
          window opening up space for other tabs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
          position and size of each tab is edited on the Tile Tabs
          Configuration Dialog or using the more powerful options in the
          Window’s “Tile” mode.&nbsp; To assist with creating a new
          Manual Configuration, options exist for initializing the tab
          positions from the Automatic or Custom Grids.&nbsp; Lastly, in
          a Manual Configuration, the display of individual tabs can be
          disabled and may be useful when working with and possibly
          annotating overlapping tabs.</font></li>

          percentage and when the Type is weight it is the weight for

    </ul>
    <h4> Explanation of Stretching</h4>
    <br>
    The space allocated to a row is determined by a combination of the
    Stretching Type and the Stretching Value.&nbsp; (Note that row and
    column stretching function identically but along different axes) as
    described below.<br>
    <h4>Percentage Stretching Type</h4>
    When a row's Type is set to Percentage, that row is allocated the
    associated Percentage value of the window's height.&nbsp; Thus, if
    the row's Percentage Height is 20% and the Window is 1000 pixels in
    height, the row is 200 pixels in height.&nbsp; The Percentage value
    for each row should be in the range 0% to 100%.&nbsp; If the rows
    that use Percentage sum to more than 100%, then part or all of the
    last rows may not be displayed (likewise for columns).&nbsp; If
    there are no rows/columns that use Weight, then there may be blank
    unused space, depending on the percentages used." <br>
    <h5>Example of Percentage Stretching</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1: 20%</li>
      <li>Row 2: 50%</li>
      <li>Row 3: 30%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Result for a Window 1000 pixels in height:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1 Height: 200 pixels (20% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 2 Height: 500 pixels (50% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 3 Height: 300 pixels (30% of 1000)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weighted Stretching Type</h4>
    When a row's Type is set to Weight, the Height of the row is
    affected by Stretching Values of all Rows with the Stretching Type
    set to Weight.&nbsp; To determine the height of the a row, the
    weights from all rows are summed and the row's weight is divided by
    the sum.&nbsp; This result (row's weight divided by sum) becomes the
    percentage of the window's height allocated to the row.<br>
    <h5>Example of Weighted Stretching</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1: 1.0</li>
      <li>Row 2: 2.0</li>
      <li>Row 3: 1.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Result for a Window 1000 pixels in height (Note: sum of weights
      is 4.0):<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1 Height: 250 pixels&nbsp;&nbsp; ((1.0 / 4.0) * 1000 =
        250) </li>
      <li>Row 2 Height: 500 pixels &nbsp; ((2.0 / 4.0) * 1000 = 500)</li>
      <li>Row 3 Height: 250 pixels&nbsp;&nbsp; ((1.0 / 4.0) * 1000 =
        250)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Combination of Percentage and Weighted Stretching</h4>
    When both Percentage and Weighted Stretching are used, rows with
    Percentage stretching are assigned their requested height percentage
    and any remaining space is allocated to rows with weighted
    Stretching. <br>
    <h5>Example of Percentage and Weighted Stretching</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1: Percentage, 20%</li>
      <li>Row 2: Percentage, 30%</li>
      <li>Row 3: Weighted, 1.0</li>
      <li>Row 4: Weighted, 2.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Result for a Window 1000 pixels in height (Note: Sum of
      Percentages is 50% and Sum of Weights is 3.0): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1 Height: 200 pixels (20% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 2 Height: 300 pixels (30% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 3 Height: 166 pixels ((1.0 / 3.0) * 50% * 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 4 Height: 334 pixels ((2.0 / 3.0) * 50% * 1000)</li>
    </ul>
    Now Suppose a 5th row is added with a Weight of 1.0 (the Sum of
    Weights is 4.0).&nbsp; Notice that the Percentage Type rows remain
    the same height and the Weighted Type rows shrink in height to
    accommodate the new row:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Row 1 Height: 200 pixels (20% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 2 Height: 300 pixels (30% of 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 3 Height: 125 pixels ((1.0 / 4.0) * 50% * 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 4 Height: 250 pixels ((2.0 / 4.0) * 50% * 1000)</li>
      <li>Row 5 Height: 125 pixels ((1.0 / 4.0) * 50% * 1000)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Summary of Percentage and Weighted Stretching</h5>
    <p>The advantage of using Percentage stretching is that the row will
      be allocated the requested percentage of the window's
      height.&nbsp; The disadvantage of Percentage Stretching is that if
      all rows use Percentage Stretching, and a row is added or removed,
      the user will need to adjust the stretching percentages to ensure
      all rows are visible (when a row is added) or to remove empty
      space (when a row is removed).<br>
    </p>
    <p>The advantage of Weighted stretching is that all of the vertical
      space will be used and the available space is automatically
      reallocated when a row is added or removed.&nbsp; The disadvantage
      is that if rows use different weights, calculations are required
      to get the desired row heights.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In some instances using both Percentage and Weighted Stretching
      may be best. &nbsp; One such instance is when the first row's
      Content is set to Spacer and Annotation are added to the Spacer
      Row for use as Column Titles.&nbsp; In this case, the
      recommendation is to use Percentage for this Row and Weight for
      the Rows below containing the Brain Models.&nbsp; As Rows for
      Brain Models are added as removed, the Column Titles will remain
      the same size and the Rows containing the Brain Models will occupy
      all of the remaining vertical space.<br>

    <br>
    Located in the Mode section of the Toolbar is new mode named
    “Tile”.&nbsp; When Tile Tabs is enabled and the Active Configuration

    are added at the bottom of the Toolbar for editing the position and
    size of the selected tab(s).&nbsp; All numerical values in the
    editing controls are in Window Percentages with zero percent at the
    bottom/left and one-hundred percent at the right/top. <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bounds</b> – Controls for changing the size of the tab by
        moving the tab’s sides.&nbsp; Moving one of the bounds will
